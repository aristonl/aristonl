I'm Ariston Lorenzo, a 14y/o developer based in Washington DC. I'm currently
work on projects related to a group I created with Levi Hicks (FiReLScar) called
N11 (Null). 

We are working on an operating system called Hydra with a kernel
called Inferno. I'm also currently developing many programs that will go along
with the operating system such as a text editor, C compiler, custom 'make'
implementation, and a new version control system.
