I'm Ariston Lorenzo, a 14y/o developer based in Washington DC. I'm currently
work on projects related to a group I created with Levi Hicks (FiReLScar) called
N11 (Null). 

We are working on an operating system called Hydra with a kernel
called Inferno. I'm also currently developing many programs that will go along
with the operating system such as a text editor, C compiler, custom 'make'
implementation, and a new version control system.

INFERNO
_______

	Inferno is an AMD64-based kernel built in C++ with UNIX/POSIX compliance
	in mind. Inferno also plans to support ARM64 in the future (mainly for
	Apple Silicon usage). Inferno is meant to work in tandem with Hydra, the
	operating system. Hydra/Inferno is meant to act as an alternative to 
	most other operating systems, with a main focus on modern systems.

LINK
____
	
	Link is a web server library that is meant to be fast and easy to use.
	Think __ExpressJS__ but for C++. Link is mainly developed by Levi Hicks
	and can be found also at N11 Software. You can find an example
	project/website built with Link on GitHub at aristonl/linkproj.git.

GITSERV
_______

	"gitserv" is meant to be a secure, easy-to-use, and fast way to make a
	fully functional git server. Nowadays we have things like GitHub, GitLab
	but these don't really represent what Git was originally meant for,
	patches and mailing lists. gitserv is meant to deal with all of these
	things for you without you having to do much but having the ease-of-mind
	that you're secured.

NEON
____

	"neon" is a version control system built (mainly) as a side project but
	also as the __future__ source control management tool used at N11. 
	"neon" is purely focused on using "patches" and combines the best of
	a centralised VCS like CVS/RCS and a distributed VCS like Git.
